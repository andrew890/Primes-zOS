# Primes-zOS

This repository contains z/OS adapted solutions for programs from 
[Dave Plummer's Software Drag Racing](https://github.com/PlummersSoftwareLLC/Primes) repository. See the original repository for a description of the project.

These are z/OS specific adaptations rather than improved/faster versions so they do not add anything to the drag racing project. For that reason they have not been incorporated into the original repository.

They are provided here for people who want to try the drag racing code on z/OS.

The code will still run on other Unix like systems (but not native Windows).
